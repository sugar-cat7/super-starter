# Native prerequisites and verification

The selected Desktop package owns `src-tauri/rust-toolchain.toml`, Cargo.lock, Tauri config/capabilities and its SPA. Web/API-only projects install no Rust or Tauri package. Install rustup using its [official installation](https://rustup.rs/) for your existing development environment; setup activates the package's pinned toolchain. No root Rust pin is duplicated in mise.

Follow [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/): macOS Xcode command-line tools; Windows MSVC C++ tools and WebView2; Linux GTK3, WebKitGTK 4.1, libayatana-appindicator, librsvg, patchelf and build tools. On an environment you cannot provision, doctor reports the missing libraries. CI's standard hosted Linux image installs those packages and uses Xvfb. A Linux result does not certify Windows/macOS.

The package scripts `test:rust`, `test:native`, `test:release`, `build` and optional `build:bundle` operate independently. `pnpm build` builds each selected package; Desktop's ordinary build is unsigned and has no bundle/publication step. Signed installers, certificates, notarization and distribution require separate authorized work.

Native E2E follows the [current Tauri recommendation](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/tests/webdriver/) and [embedded WebdriverIO setup](https://webdriver.io/docs/desktop-testing/tauri/plugin-setup). Cargo feature `e2e`, test config/capabilities, renderer mode and target directory are separate. It starts the real app on Linux/macOS/Windows and invokes real Rust CRUD, cancel/error/export and denied unknown commands. A test-only process environment chooses an export fixture; production IPC accepts no path. Normal release rebuilds without the feature/import/global API, checks dependency/capability/frontend isolation, starts the native window and verifies that setting the test driver port cannot enable a listener.

User-selected native dialog interaction is distinct from the controlled E2E fixture. Remote connections, public distribution and signing have not been performed by setup or CI.

If an existing Linux environment provides Docker but cannot install system libraries, the optional `tools/dev-environment/native.Dockerfile` provisions the same official prerequisites. This is still Linux validation. It uses standard package commands and no privileged container or host networking. Build an image, mount this project and the tools selected by mise, then work inside it:

```sh
mise install
docker build --build-arg DEVELOPMENT_UID="$(id -u)" -f tools/dev-environment/native.Dockerfile -t starter-native-dev tools/dev-environment
STARTER_NODE_DIR="$(mise where node)"
STARTER_PNPM_DIR="$(mise where aqua:pnpm/pnpm)"
mkdir -p .state/container-home .state/container-tmp
docker run --rm -it \
  --mount "type=bind,src=$PWD,dst=/project" \
  --mount "type=bind,src=$PWD/.state/container-home,dst=/home/developer" \
  --mount "type=bind,src=$PWD/.state/container-tmp,dst=/tmp" \
  --mount "type=bind,src=$STARTER_NODE_DIR,dst=/opt/node,readonly" \
  --mount "type=bind,src=$STARTER_PNPM_DIR/pnpm,dst=/usr/local/bin/pnpm,readonly" \
  --env PATH=/opt/node/bin:/usr/local/cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin \
  --env CARGO_HOME=/home/developer/.cargo \
  starter-native-dev bash
pnpm env:setup
pnpm env:doctor
xvfb-run -a pnpm dev -- desktop
xvfb-run -a pnpm gate:full
```

For non-interactive execution omit `-it` and append `bash -c '<command>'`. A managed network may require its approved CA during image build (`--secret id=system_ca,src=<public-ca-bundle>`) and runtime; use the environment's documented trust/proxy configuration without disabling certificate verification. Cache only this project's `.state`/dependencies and an owned Cargo registry volume. Git operations use the mounted repository's local hooks; Docker and Rust are unnecessary for presets without Desktop.
